# Meal-Mate
MAD project

Meal Mate is a mobile application designed to address the economic crisis in Sri Lanka by minimizing
food wastage and facilitating the sharing of food. The app enables users to donate or request meals,
with a focus on university students but available to anyone in need, including those in offices, schools,
classes, and even villages.
Through Meal Mate, users can easily donate leftover food, meals prepared in excess, or unneeded food
items to those who need them. Similarly, users can also request meals when in need, thus promoting a
culture of sharing and reducing food waste.
The applicationâ€™s primary aim is to minimize food wastage in Sri Lanka, where a significant amount of
money is spent on importing food. By connecting individuals who have surplus food with those who
need it, Meal Mate seeks to promote self sufficiency and mutual support in the face of economic
pressure in the community.
With its user friendly interface, Meal Mate encourages a sense of community and collaboration,
promoting a sustainable and equitable food system. Overall, Meal Mate will be an innovative solution
that aims to reduce food wastage and promote food sharing to address Sri Lanka's economic crisis.
